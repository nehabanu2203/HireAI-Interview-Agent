## Recommended workflow for demos

- Start the app locally using the command above.
- Use the `Interview` sidebar, enter candidate info and start the interview.
- Answer questions and view evaluation results and final report.
- Use the `Recruiter Dashboard` to inspect and delete saved interview records.

## Troubleshooting

- If Streamlit fails to start, ensure the virtual environment is activated and dependencies are installed.
- If Groq API fails, the app falls back to default questions and a basic evaluation summary; check `GROQ_API_KEY` in your `.env`.
- If you see errors saving data, ensure the `data/` directory exists (the app creates it automatically on save).
